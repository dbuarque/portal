            A stellar account is composed of a keypair, two keys - a public key and a secret key. The public key is kind of like your email address for money.
            You give it to other people so that they can send you money! The secret key is <span class="error-text"><strong>HIGHLY SENSITIVE</strong></span>.
            You use your secret key to control you account. <strong>ANYBODY WHO HAS YOUR SECRET KEY HAS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong>
            Below, choose an option so we can obtain your account's public key.
